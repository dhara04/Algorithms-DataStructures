# Algorithms-DataStructures
This is an attempt to document the process of internalizing the important Data Structures &amp; Algorithms in Computer Science.First write them all in C++ (which is my breadwinner programming language) and then repeating the same process in Python.

While many might wonder what's the need of doing this twice,I have 2 reasons for this :
1)Making use of Repetition as a way to drive the knowledge deep in my memory.
2)Get well versed in Python.


Stay Blessed everyone !
Need the perseverence to drive through till the end of this project.
